# Drake e-commerce React Native App

## Description
	This is a basic showcase e-commerce React Native App done with the use of react-navigation and redux, please any question don't hesitate to reach out

## Installation
 0. A very important thing to have in my is to have the proper SDK installed depending your OS and your phone target platform (Android or iOS), I've been developing for Android in windows so I followed this guide: [Android SDK setup for React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#android-sdk)
 for iOS the case would be: [iOS guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?platform=ios&os=macos#installing-dependencies)

 1. Install nodejs, react native CLI in your computer, yarn is preferable because is what I've been relying in the development stage.
 2. Clone the repository in any dir of preference
 3. Run `yarn install` or `npm install` in the root project folder
 4. First you need to run `npx react-native start` to run the metro bundler
 5. Run `yarn react-native run-android` or `npx run android`
 6. You can use the app now

## What are the products?
	The "products" are Super Smash Bros Characters, the prices are randomly assignated in app runtime.

## Structure:
	The application is a react-navigation "stack" that wraps 3 main screens and also involves a component (the cart component).

### DISCLAIMER
	This is only a showcase demo for my portfolio,
	I do not own any of the images or characters show in this demo, all the trade rights of those goes to NINTENDO.
